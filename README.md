# Sorting-Algorithms
College Project.
The Program includes six sorting algorithms. Three of which with a time complexity of O(ùëõ ). These Three are: Insertion sort, Selection sort, and Bubble sort. 
The other three algorithms are of time complexity O(nlogn) in the average case. Those algorithms are: Merge sort, Heap sort, and Quick sort. 
Those algorithms are defined in the program as functions. Each algorithm has separatefunction/s. The main function of each of the algorithms 
is to compare elements in different arrays, and to swap the elements until the array is sorted. First, we generated five different arrays
of random elements of sizes 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, and 100000. Then, the program sorts all the arrays using the six sorting techniques, while
simultaneously computing the running time of each algorithm. The running time differs according to the algorithm used and the number of elements in
the array. The main aim of the program is to show the running time of each algorithm using different-sized arrays.
